Collection of useful code related to biological analysis. Much of this is 
discussed with examples at [Blue collar bioinformatics][1].

Some projects which may be especially interesting:

* ec2 -- An automated environment to installs useful biological software and 
  libraries. This is used to bootstrap blank machines, such as those you'd 
  find on Cloud providers such as Amazon, to ready to go analysis workstations.
  See the [CloudBioLinux][2] effort for more details.
* gff -- A GFF parsing library in Python, aimed for inclusion into Biopython.
* nextgen -- Automated analysis pipeline for processing next generation
  sequencing data. This is tightly integrated with the Galaxy web framework.
