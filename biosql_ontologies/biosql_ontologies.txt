A recent <a href="http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biosql-l/2008-November/001412.html">thread</a> by Peter on the BioSQL mailing list
initiated some thinking about formalizing ontologies and terms in BioSQL. This
is already formalized in an ad-hoc way in that BioPerl, BioPython and BioJava
attempt to do the same thing. However, the problem is that this is not
documented, no one is likely in a big hurry to document it, and we are
essentially inventing another ontology.
</p>

<p>
The BioSQL methodology of storing key/value pair information on items can be
mapped to RDF triples as:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>BioSQL</th><th>RDF</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bioentry or other (feature) </td><td>  Subject</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ontology                    </td><td>  Namespace of predicate</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Term                        </td><td>  predicate item (in namespace)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Value                       </td><td>  Object</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Thus, a nice place to look for ontologies is thus in standards intended for RDF
normalization. Greg Tyrelle thought this same way a while ago and came up with
a XSLT to <a href="http://wiki.nodalpoint.org/semweb_hacks">transform GenBank XML to RDF</a>.
This uses mostly the <a href="http://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/">Sequence Ontology project</a>
provides an ontology meant for describing biological sequences. This includes
a <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/so_mappings.shtml">mapping</a> 
to GenBank feature table names.
</p>

<p>
Using these as a starting point, I generated a mapping of GenBank names to
names in these two ontologies. This is meant as a starting point for
standardizing and documenting naming in BioSQL. The mapping file thus far
covers almost all of the header and feature keys, and more than half of the
qualifier keys. You


The python code that does the mapping and pulls 
information from associated files is on <a
href="http://github.com/chapmanb/bcbb/tree/master">github</a>.
</p>

Some notes on the mapping:

<ul>
<li>
Cross references to other identifiers are mapped with the Dublin Core term
'relation'. These can occur in many places in the GenBank format, and we
can flatten them with this term and using a value in the form of
<database:identifier> the way it is currently done in the /db_xref qualifier.
</li>

<li>
Multiple names or descriptions of an item, also stored in multiple places in
GenBank files, receive the Dublin Core term 'alternative.'
</li>

<li>
Organism and taxonomy ontologies are a whole project onto themselves, so I
didn't try to tackle them here.
</li>
</ul>
